## Challenge

This challange is from Compass UOL for the interns to complete and learn experiences.<br><br>
The main objective was to build, in 9 days, a front-end development based on the design in Figma.<br><br>
To accomplish this task, the only technologies allowed to use were HTML, CSS and JavaScript, being banned to use any framework or libraries to create the application.<br><br>
This project contains the main page, with information about the Rescue Center. The buttons *Donate Button* and *Apply to Adopt* open the *Donate Modal* and the *Adopt Modal*, respectively. The button *View Adoptables* open a new page html with the list of the availables pets for adoption. Every page has a button to go back to the main page and the Modals have a button to cancel the action, also returning to the main page.<br><br>
After the user donate, apply to adopt or subscribe an email to the newsletter, the page success appears with a message. The page success was free to create any content.

## Difficulties

While developing this web page, I faced some challenges that helped me to learn experience. Here are some examples:

- To create the Donate and Adopt Modals: I was not familiar to the tag < dialog >, and I had to do a search about how it works and how to open and close the Modals
- To style the radio inputs in the payment method in the Donate Modal: Basic, I had to disable the appearance of the input and do a style in the label, increasing the hit area to select the radio.
- The forms validation: To prevent the forms being submitted without the correct information, I had to manipulate the input values with regular expressions (regex), which was something new for me. With the correct pattern, the forms can be submitted.
- This project don't have mobile version: The responsive design was optional and I didn't have time to do it, so I intend to do it later.

These experiences and more that I didn't list taught me valuable lessons in adaptability and perseverance, enhancing my web delevopment skills.
