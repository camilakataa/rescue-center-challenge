## Challenge

This project is a challenge from Compass UOL for the interns to complete and learn experiences.<br>
The main objective was to build a front-end development based on the design in Figma.<br>
To accomplish this task, the only technologies allowed to use were HTML, CSS and JavaScript, being banned to use any framework or libraries to create the application.


## Figma

The challenge was based accordingly to the design and user interface in [Figma](https://abrupt-sword-b4e.notion.site/Desafio-Semana-4-AWS_FRONTEND_MAI24-ad336ce3d399478aab126561a92fe3a9)

## Steps

I used HTML for create the structure content of the pages, trying to do as much semantic element as possible, helping define the purpose of different parts of the content.<br>
The CSS was used to integrating the HTML with styling, adding some colors, positions <br>
The JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior with buttons, modals and links to navigate between differents pages.<br>
After each section made in HTML with style in CSS, i did a commit to save my progress, doing step by step.

## Difficulties

While developing this web page, I faced some challenges that helped me to learn experience. Here are some examples:

- To create the Donate and Adopt Modals: I was not familiar to the tag < dialog >, and I had to do a search about how it works and how to open and close the Modals
- To style the radio inputs in the payment method in the Donate Modal: Basic, I had to disable the appearance of the input and do a style in the label, increasing the hit area to select the radio.
- The forms validation: To prevent the forms being submitted without the correct information, I had to manipulate the input values with regular expressions (regex), which was something new for me. With the correct pattern, the forms can be submitted.

These experiences and more that I didn't list taught me valuable lessons in adaptability and perseverance, enhancing my web delevopment skills.

## Tools

- HTML with semantic elements
- Style with CSS
